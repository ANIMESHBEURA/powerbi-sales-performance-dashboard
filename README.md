It is designed to help stakeholders quickly understand key business metrics and trends.

The dataset contains transactional sales data with the following attributes:
- Product

- Orders
- Sales Date
- State, City, Country
- Sales Channel (Store, Online, Direct)

The data was cleaned and modeled using Power Query and a star schema approach.
